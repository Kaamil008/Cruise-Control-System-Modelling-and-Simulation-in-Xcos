Cruise sontrol system is on of the key developments in driver assitance systems, In this model we model the cruise control system of an Automobile based on industry parameters and drive cycle data, courtesy of Decibels Lab, Bangalore.
We use 3 reference velocites, one a constant veloctity of 25 km/hr, the next is from NEDC Drive cycle and last is from WLTP Drive cycle, we generate comparison graphs between reference Velocity and Vehicle Velocity.
