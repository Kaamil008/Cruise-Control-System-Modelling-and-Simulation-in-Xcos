# Cruise-Control-System-Modelling-and-Simulation-in-Xcos
Cruise control system is on of the key developments in driver assitance systems, In this model we develop the cruise control system of an Automobile using PI controller logic for speed control. Input parameters and drive cycle data are based on industry standard, courtesy of Decibels Lab, Bangalore.
We use 3 reference velocites, a constant veloctity of 25 km/hr, the next is from NEDC Drive cycle and last is from WLTP Drive cycle, we generate comparison graphs between reference Velocity and Vehicle Velocity.
